Blackjack Game (Python Console Version)
A simple Python-based Blackjack game that you can play in the terminal. This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of the classic Blackjack game using basic Python concepts.

How to Play
You and the dealer (computer) are each dealt 2 cards.

The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Face cards (J, Q, K) count as 10, and Aces count as 11 or 1 depending on the hand.

A Blackjack (Ace + 10) instantly wins unless the dealer also has one.

The dealer draws cards until their total is 17 or more.

If either player goes over 21, they lose.

Rules Implemented
The deck is infinite in size.

No jokers.

Cards are not removed after drawing (equal probability for all).

The Ace can count as 11 or 1, depending on the current score.

Blackjack is defined as a hand of two cards that sum to 21.

The user can choose to draw another card or pass.

The dealer automatically draws until reaching 17 or higher.
